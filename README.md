#Intoduction

Sometimes, it is common that the significance of selecting and entering a major that associated with students interests is overstated. This is not reasonable for the reason that it cannot be sure that the major they interested in is the major fit them. ACT has conducted some research and has shown that students tend to keep the same or similar majors in their first year of college as their indicated planned major over time. And by research ACT has data of them about the fit level of their indicated major and best-fit major index, which is quite helpful for students to know about themselves and can predict the prospect according to the fit level about their interested and indicated major.
The majors students interested in cannot be necessary the major actually fit them. The ACT does the research and has data regarding students’ measured—rather than self-reported—interests and has developed a “fit index” that can help accurately predict success based on their fit with selected or intended majors. But from the data, it is not clear about the useful features and patterns about the attributes, and the original data cannot present the correlation with them. VPG’s contest challenge is to develop a visual representation of Interest Perceived vs. Actual data that helps to relate the complexities of how students’ measured interests match with their indicated plans, declared majors, or their persistence into their sophomore year.
So, appropriate data processing and design visualization is significant, which can help viewers to have a intuitive and clear sight of the data.

## Concept of project and data
The ACT (originally an abbreviation of American College Testing) is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States. It was first introduced in November 1959 by University of Iowa professor Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). It is now administered by ACT, a nonprofit organization of the same name.
